Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The user needed to be prompted to make an account and log in, the usernames and passwords should be stored in a database, and if they are new users they will be given the option to register a new account.  Create a database shell that will store inventory items in which the user can populate the details.  No information should be lost when closing the application.  The database should permit the user to create, delete, update, and read data items. User must recieve prompt for permission to send sms mssaing notifications. Alerts correspond to a triggers setup within the code.  If the permission is denied, the user can still utilize the app functions.  

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

Necessary screens for development were a login screen that has username and password text boxes with two buttons; login and register.  The register button takes you to another screen in which the user will input their login information.  Once logged in, the main screen will appear, prompted the user with a few options, enable sms button and add inventory item button.  Once items exist in the database, they will appear on the main screen in a grid format and will be selectable to which another screen will appear.  One the item screen, the user can change the details, quantity, and price.  The update/create button work in tandem, if the item does not exist in the database, it will be added to the grid, if you are updating an existing item, the button will just save your changes.  I believe these designs were successful because each screen is easy to comprehend and moving between screens is seemless. 

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

I referenced code that I know worked through the learning material and begin trying to work it into my code.  If I got stuck, I would search the web for details on the libraries being used and see if I could piece something together myself with the reference as a guide.  

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

Every time I make changes to the code, I run the debugger and correct any errors that may occur.  Once the code is error free, I run the simulator to check functionality.  It revealed any minor changes can have an impact on overall functionality if the right code is not used.  

Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

The planning period is the most important for innovation.  When attempting to conceptualize the user needs into a model of the application requires the most amount of innovation.  Their needs may not be readily available on the market and coming up with a new design tailored to them is innovation.  

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

During the layout design, it was just one part of the ciricullum that stuck with me.
